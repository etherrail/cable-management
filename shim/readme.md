# Extrusion Shims
Cheap extrusions sadly result in bad length accuracy.
We have had multiple, actually the majority, of our ordered extrusions cut too short - usually by 1mm.
This is bad, but we like to stay optimistic so we figured out a workaround.

3D-printed shims, which can be inserted at the end of an extrusion to level out any inaccuracies.

The shims have a little bonus: Adding an extrusion into an existing frame is almost impossible, as you'd need to flex the extrusions to get a new one in.
With the shims, we can just put them in and then add a shim later on.

Print the shims first and check how big the actually turn out, as the printers are usually not that accurate.
Beware that at some point the shims prevent the Quick-Connect hammers from locking in.
