# Camera Bracket
Attaches a [Ubiquity G5 Flex Camera](https://techspecs.ui.com/unifi/cameras-nvrs/uvc-g5-flex?s=eu#datasheet) to the gird.

The camera is attached thru a single ethernet cable, which powers it over PoE.
A infrared-based night mode enables viewing the fiddle yard, even when the lights are off.
It can be accessed remotely, while recording locally to our router.

We use the camera to view our hidden sections during operation, and to reconstruct accidents on the layout.
