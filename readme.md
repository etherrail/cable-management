# Cable Management
This repository contains parts used for cable management on our testing facility.
We use 30x30 B-Type aluminium extrusions to support the whole layout ([European B30 extrusion supplier](https://www.motedis.com/de/Aluprofil-30x30-B-Typ-Nut-8)).
The parts fit the extrusion and are extensively used on our layout.

The B30 extrusions use a M5 size quick connect part, thus all parts mounted on the extrusion will use M5 threads.

All parts were designed in Fusion 360, message us if you need access to the source files.

`3mf` Files contain all printing parameters prepared for 3D-printing.
We use a Bambu Lab X1-Carbon printer to print parts for our layout.

> Warning: Some of the parts in this repository enclose or handle 230V mains voltage.
> You MUST get your electrical work checked by a professional before use, including the parts.
